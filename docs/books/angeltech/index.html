<ul>
<li>September 25, 2014</li>

<li>The Art of Getting High and Staying There.
<ul>
<li>September 25, 2014</li>

<ul>
<li>January 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CHAPEL PERILOUS is where souls go when they are lost and FACTOR &lsquo;X&rsquo; communications refer to how souls are found.
<ul>
<li>September 25, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communication only occurs between equals.

<li>When we fall in love with a map over the very territory itself, a wily creature is born that well call dogma

</ul>
</li>
<li>Teachers. They will arrive at the right time in the right place. However, they do not have to be people. Teachers can be situations, serving to catalize and provoke change within us.
<ul>
<li>September 26, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as Babies, we&rsquo;re so open that we really don&rsquo;t know the difference between the world and ourselves
<ul>
<li>September 26, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is why Kids make the best gangs. They know how important winning is.

<li>It&rsquo;s all political from our point of view because we&rsquo;re political animals.

</li>
<li>they&rsquo;re real good at making things up, whether they are real or not..
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in order to graduate into Fourth Grade, we have to know what is &ldquo;real&rdquo; from what is &ldquo;not.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The four main map-making tools are Reading, Writing, Arithmetic and Speaking.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This creates &ldquo;perspective&rdquo; by the emotional distance of abstraction
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we lose our perspective when we&rsquo;re too emotional or physical.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developing a sense of humor also helps us keep perspective.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>words only reflect and suggest truth; they are not identical with it.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everybody wants to survive unless somebody has made the choice to die.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>

</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s difficult to be creative if you&rsquo;re worrying about your
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Karma, as defined here, implies those Life Lessons by which our destiny reveals itself;
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>synchronize with a higher purpose than mere mechanical living.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>this lack of inner distinction has been known to entertain an entire family of negative emotions.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sooner we come to accept our mechanical, robotic self, the sooner we can find the &ldquo;mold&rdquo; and break free
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>confessing our &ldquo;conditioned&rdquo; robothood
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This starts when our &ldquo;true feelings&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>become more rewarding than our conditioned responses
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gear One Physical Survival. This is the slowest moving gear and rotates by meeting security needs.
<ul>
<li>September 27, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emotional, Conceptual, and Social Security
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>freedom within a form is as free as we get
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Freedom is realized when this 4-fold structure is thoroughly absorbed, organized and communicated in your own way.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By finding out where each gear turns within us, it is possible to begin watching your karma
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I was mechanical and knowing this kind of fascinated me. I mean, I wasn&rsquo;t as attached anymore. How could I be?
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d say being a karma mechanic is an attractive idea in these times of growning social uniformity and standardization, don&rsquo;t you think?
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can choose how to survive. Freedom is really just a matter of style
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s basically an artistic endeavor
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everybody&rsquo;s an artist: And my life became my first art project.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s a lot of anti-life influence going around in the mass media.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>woven into the social fabric of a great dying beast.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remeber, children have nightmares to wake up.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excitement &amp; Resistance
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>excitements and resistances take turns being each other. We become what we resist.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we attract situations, persons and lessons geared to elucidate our karma or &ldquo;destiny&rdquo;.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The shape of our destiny can be altered, if needed, by first reading the karmic code.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no Energy Shortage, only Energy Blockage. Remove the Block and Life takes care of itself. The nicest things happen by themselves.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the mechanical tendencies of resisting resistance and judging excitement and versa visa.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the act of regarding resistance and excitement as sacred
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More specifically, it means relating to resistance as energy itself.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resistance may not feel energetic but that is the illusion Life casts in its frozen state.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As an alternative to resisting resistance, try blending with it. For further instructions, don&rsquo;t hold your breath. As for excitement, an alternative to resisting or judging it is: Let it Shah You.. .tremble.. .quiver and sigh.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have the choice of reclaiming your body: Become your own parent and protect yourself.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s necessary to oscillate between the roles of Mother and Infant.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>outlooks necessary for understanding Biological or Physical Intelligence.
<ul>
<li>September 28, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once safety is absorbed
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physical safety isn&rsquo;t always best communicated through talking. It can be, simply transmitted or radiated, as a sense of well being. Other bodies pick this up instantly and are put at ease.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communicating physical safety is the same thing as being instinctively confident.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ancient Kabbalah views the body as a denser form of spirit.
<ul>

</li>
<li>see differences while at the same time maintaining unity.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whose body are you in?
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our physical body is the only part of ourselves that is always in present time
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reclaiming First Gear means confronting our commitment to being on the planet, physically
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>operating under the strain of a sophisticated death wish with the best of intentions yet
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The body&rsquo;s central need is to be felt deeply
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if listened to and spoken with, it becomes the doorway to your whole self.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Body-images held that do not refer to the organism&rsquo;s unique and ever-changing nature are invitations to conflict, drain and disintegration.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>our ideas of ourselves must reflect life or struggle against living.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The physical body is the visible manifestation of the so-called Subconscious Mind
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing can be hidden. The body communicates it all.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To the degree we are able to speak with our body, we are also speaking with the subconscious
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Body/Mind rapport is the same thing as Subconscious/Conscious rapport.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a style of communication which recognizes the element of space as a value.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The organism loves space and knows itself by its movement in space.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speaking In Blanks.. .just enough incompleteness to evoke as well as explain.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conscious avoidance of generalizations
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If such an experience is immediately transferred to the unwittingly negated
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A simple shift in semantics can make all the difference in the world in winning your body back again.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physical Intelligence naturally avoids what is toxic and approaches what is nourishing
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the body must assimilate, or digest, what has been absorbed before anything else can be taken in.
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal Freedom, Status and Political Awareness
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emotions get excited whenever ones sense of self, or territory, is diminished and/or augmented
<ul>
<li>September 30, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Status is simply knowing your particular position in any given situation and also, where the power is.
<ul>
<li>October 1, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power is precisely proportional by the depth of our motive.
<ul>
<li>October 1, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being &ldquo;selfish&rdquo; is not bad. It is simply limiting
<ul>
<li>October 1, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Living is an honor
<ul>
<li>October 1, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Victims do not exist unless we have defined one or two other role players: &ldquo;saviors&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;persecutors,

</ul>
</li>
<li>holy trinity of emotional game
<ul>
<li>October 1, 2014</li>

<li>save ourselves and/or providing our own punishment by playing the game intentionally.
<ul>
<li>October 1, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>finding the freedom we have to express ourselves
<ul>
<li>October 1, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are basically two types of winning: 1) Where you get ahead and 2) Where everyone gets ahead. Since the second type of winning already includes the first type inherently, that is where well begin
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WHATEVER IS NOT MUTUAL IS RELEASED.
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gear Two processes anger. When our personal space is violated, it&rsquo;s only natural to push the intrusion out, unless Second Gear is a bit rusty and &ldquo;back-up&rdquo; Gear One processes fear instead
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confusion can be a natural result of too much unassimilated information.
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confusion is a conceptual survival signal.

<li>making maps as fast as you absorb information.
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you haven&rsquo;t discovered a way to start this process, it will become easier for you to: 1) Live in the past 2) Grow stupid and 3) Become a dogmatic, little bigot.
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The illusion is that reality changes. The reality is that only your maps do.
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This symbolic skill of translating signals into useful information emerges as we come to think of ourselves more as interpreters, rather than &ldquo;creators&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>October 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your values become to closely focused into either of these two &ldquo;red zones&rdquo;, your capacity for communication will deteriorate along with the overall degree of your Conceptual Intelligence.
