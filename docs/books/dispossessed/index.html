<li>A stone lay there. It was dark like the wall, but on it, or inside it, there was a number; and 5 he thought at first, then took it for 1 then understood what it was‚Äîthe primal number, that was both unity and plurality. ‚ÄúThat is the cornerstone

</li>
<li>Forbidden? Nonorganic word. Who forbids? You‚Äôre externalizing the integrative function itself
<ul>
<li>May 6, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Their central function wasn‚Äôt being wasted. They were working: doing what they wanted to do. He was not working. He was being worked.
<ul>
<li>May 6, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having‚Äôs wrong; sharing‚Äôs right.

<li>Beshun, expert in delight, took him into the heart of sexuality, where there is no rancor and no ineptitude, where the two bodies striving to join each other annihilate the moment in

<li>May 6, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They were overintellectual. They didn‚Äôt seem to want to commit themselves either to work or to sex.
<ul>
<li>May 6, 2017</li>

<li>They are a coordinating system for all syndicates, do not govern persons; they administer production. They have no authority either to support me or to prevent me. They can only tell us the public opinion of us‚Äîwhere we stand in the social conscience. That‚Äôs what you want to know?

<li>they held to the ideal of complex organicism. They built the roads first, the houses second

</ul>
</li>
<li>And from the start the Settlers were aware that that unavoidable centralization was a lasting threat, to be countered by lasting vigilance.

<li>‚ÄúExcess is excrement,‚Äù Odo wrote in the Analogy. ‚ÄúExcrement retained in the body is a poison.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>May 21, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There were no disguises and no advertisements. It was all there, all the work, all the life of the city, open to the eye and to the hand.
<ul>
<li>May 21, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Privilege is responsibility. Correct?‚Äù
<ul>
<li>May 21, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you found a pack of explosive caps in the street would you ‚Äòshare‚Äô them with every kid that went by? Those books are explosives. Now do you follow me?
<ul>
<li>May 21, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did such people actually exchange ideas with free people in a nonaggressive, voluntary manner?
<ul>
<li>May 21, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But for those who accepted the privilege and obligation of human solidarity, privacy was a value only where it served a function.
<ul>
<li>May 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lack of physical labor, lack of variety of occupation, lack of social and sexual intercourse, none of these appeared to him as lacks, but as freedom
<ul>
<li>May 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The universe as a giant harpstring, oscillating in and out of existence!
<ul>
<li>May 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can true function arise from basic dysfunction?
<ul>

<li>‚ÄúStop egoizing,‚Äù the doctor said. ‚ÄúRoll over.‚Äù Shevek obeyed.
<ul>
<li>May 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They play dominance games there.
<ul>
<li>May 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I confess to being proud of you. That‚Äôs strange, isn‚Äôt it? Unreasonable. Propertarian, even.
<ul>
<li>May 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But as one gets older one needs certain reassurances that aren‚Äôt, always, entirely reasonable. In order to go on at all.
<ul>
<li>May 23, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄúIt might have been better,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif you‚Äôd gone on thinking of me as a statistic too.‚Äù

<li>‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthat I was trying to make a claim on you. But I thought in terms of your making a claim on me. If you wanted to.‚Äù

<li>It appeared to Shevek that their freedom from obligation was in exact proportion to their lack of freedom of initiative.
<ul>
<li>May 24, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He was appalled by the examination system, when it was explained to him; he could not imagine a greater deterrent to the natural wish to learn than this pattern of cramming in information and disgorging it at demand.
<ul>
<li>May 24, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In feudal times the aristocracy had sent their sons to university, conferring superiority on the institution. Nowadays it was the other way round: the university conferred superiority on the man.
<ul>
<li>May 24, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>all the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion

<li>everything either useless to begin with or ornamented so as to disguise its use;

<li>All the people in all the shops were either buyers or sellers. They had no relation to the things but that of possession.

</li>
<li>‚ÄúPae is a pretty good physicist And very obliging. But I don‚Äôt trust him.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell . . . he evades.‚Äù

<li>They think if people can possess enough things they will be content to live in prison.
<ul>
<li>May 25, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚ÄúTo make a thief, make an owner; to create crime, create laws. The Social Organism.‚Äù
<ul>
<li>May 25, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There‚Äôs a great deal that‚Äôs admirable, I‚Äôm sure, in your society, but it doesn‚Äôt teach you to discriminate‚Äîwhich is after all the best thing civilization teaches
<ul>
<li>May 31, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No distinction was drawn between the arts and the crafts; art was not considered as having a place in life, but as being a basic technique of life, like speech.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>He copulated with a number of girls, but copulation was not the joy it ought to be. It was a mere relief of need, like evacuating, and he felt ashamed of it afterward because it involved another person as object.

<li>May 31, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a functions analyst I must point out that there is no need for orange. Orange serves no vital function in the social organism at either the cellular or the organic level, and certainly not at the holorganismic or most centrally ethical level
